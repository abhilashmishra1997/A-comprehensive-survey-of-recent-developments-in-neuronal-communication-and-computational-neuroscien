# A-comprehensive-survey-of-recent-developments-in-neuronal-communication-and-computational-neuroscience

Computational neuroscience and neuronal communication have been amongst the most sought after fields in the recent times. The integration of computational neuroscience and neuronal communication with evolution of information and communication technology leveraged the potential applications in many domains such as health care, nanomachine, pattern recognition, biological behaviour replication, designing hardwares for neurons, data mining , disease modeling. Therefore, a detailed understanding and modeling of neuron interconnection is highly essential. In this work, we have performed an extensive review of the recent developments in the fields of computational neuroscience, neuronal communication and neural learning. Further, review of computational neuroscience has been done for four broad categories, namely Leaky Integrate and Fire model, Hodgkin Huxley Model, Compartment Model and 2D reduction model. Most of these developments have come forth because of the recent developments in nanotechnology and bioinformatics. The presented work act as a reliable support for researchers from other domains of science and engineering wishing to jump start into computational neuroscience and neuronal communication .
